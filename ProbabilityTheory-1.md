# Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning
# Function Approximation & Probability Basics

---

## 1. Core Idea of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is viewed as:

```text
f : X → Y
```

where:

- `X` = input space
- `Y` = output space
- `f` = unknown mapping/function

### Goal

Estimate `f` using observed data.

---

## 2. Function Approximation

Dataset:

```text
D = {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn)}
```

Machine learning learns relationships from examples.

### Examples

- X-ray image → Diseased / Not Diseased
- Email → Spam / Not Spam

---

## 3. Why Deterministic Modeling Fails

Exact physics is too complex for real-world AI tasks.

### Examples

- Coin toss prediction
- Speech recognition
- Medical diagnosis

Hence:
- exact modeling becomes impractical.

---

## 4. Statistical Learning

Instead of exact physics:

- collect many observations,
- learn patterns statistically.

This is the foundation of modern ML.

---

## 5. Probability Theory

Probability helps in:
- decision making under uncertainty.

Even though decisions are final:
- the underlying data is uncertain.

---

## 6. Random Experiment

A process with uncertain outcome.

### Examples

- Tossing coin
- Taking X-ray
- Sending email

Every ML data point is treated as:
# outcome of a random experiment.

---

## 7. Sample Space

Set of all possible outcomes.

Denoted by:

```text
Ω
```

### Example

Coin toss:

```text
Ω = {H, T}
```

---

## 8. Events

Subsets of sample space are called:

# Events

### Example

```text
A = {H}
```

---

## 9. Measure

A measure quantifies subsets of a set.

### Example

- Length on real numbers.

Probability is also a measure.

---

## 10. Probability Measure

Probability assigns values between:

```text
0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1
```

to events.

### Properties

#### Entire Sample Space

```text
P(Ω) = 1
```

#### Empty Set

```text
P(∅) = 0
```

#### Additivity

If:

```text
A ∩ B = ∅
```

then:

```text
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)
```

---

## 11. Important Insight

Probability is:
# a mathematical abstraction.

Meaning is assigned later depending on application.

---

## 12. Data Representation

All data can be represented as:
# vectors

### Examples

- images
- text
- speech
- signals

---

## 13. Modern ML View

### Classical View

```text
Y = f(X)
```

### Modern Probabilistic View

```text
(X, Y) ~ P(X, Y)
```

Machine learning estimates:
# probability distributions

instead of exact functions.
